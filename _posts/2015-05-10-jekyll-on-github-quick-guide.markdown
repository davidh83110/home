To set up your blog using jekyll and github pages just follow the next steps. You'll be up and running in seconds.

### Step 1: Fork a theme
Many great and free themes can be found on [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/).

- [Kactus](https://github.com/nickbalestra/kactus) - A port of Cactus’s  default theme. *The one I use for this site*.
- [Mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator) - A medium inspired Jekyll blog theme.
- [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) - A simple Jekyll theme that emphasizes content
- [Kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper) - A port of Ghost’s Casper default theme.<br><br>
Just pick the theme you prefere and fork it.<br><br>


### Step 2: Rename your repository
Rename the repository you just forked as ```username.github.io``` where username is your username on GitHub.

### Step 3 - Enjoy
There is no step 3, your new blog is now live and reachable at the following address:

{% highlight javascript %}
http://username.github.io
{% endhighlight %}


##### Settings
To setup your blog, edit the ```_config.yml``` file.
You can also customize your theme by modifing any of the _layouts or _includes files.

##### Publishing
To publish a new article just add a new markdown file in the _posts directory, is that simple.

##### Testing locally
First make sure to have Jekyll installed.

{% highlight javascript %}
$ gem install jekyll
{% endhighlight %}

and then you can simply run it from the terminal

{% highlight javascript %}
jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}
